Button 3: Stop Feeding
Button 4: Sleep/Wake Toggle

# Example: Smart switches for diaper tracking
Switch 1: Log Pee Diaper
Switch 2: Log Poo Diaper
Switch 3: Log Both Types
```

### Dashboard Usage

Add this card to your Lovelace dashboard:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: glance
    title: Baby Care Status
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.baby_current_activity
        name: Current Activity
      - entity: binary_sensor.baby_currently_feeding
        name: Feeding
      - entity: binary_sensor.baby_currently_sleeping
        name: Sleeping

  - type: horizontal-stack
    cards:
      - type: button
        tap_action:
          action: call-service
          service: baby_care_tracker.start_feeding
          service_data:
            side: left
        name: Start Left
        icon: mdi:baby-bottle
      - type: button
        tap_action:

        icon: mdi:stop

  - type: entities
    title: Today's Summary
    entities:
      - sensor.baby_daily_feedings
      - sensor.baby_daily_diapers
      - sensor.baby_last_feeding_time
```

# Check Home Assistant logs
tail -f /path/to/homeassistant/config/home-assistant.log | grep baby_care_tracker
```

### Fixed Translation Error
‚úÖ The empty translation file has been fixed. The integration should now load properly.

### Common Issues

1. **"Integration not found"**
   - Ensure files are copied to the right directory
   - Restart Home Assistant completely

2. **"Button mapping not working"**
   - Verify entity IDs exist in Home Assistant
   - Check entity states in Developer Tools

3. **"Services not available"**
   - Integration may not be loaded properly
   - Check logs for errors

## üéØ Real-World Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Night Feeding
1. Keep a bedside button next to your bed
2. Map it to "Start Left Feeding" 
3. When baby wakes at 3 AM, just press the button
4. No need to fumble with phone or dashboard

### Scenario 2: Nursery Setup
1. Install 3 smart switches near changing table
2. Map them to: Pee, Poo, Both
3. After diaper change, flip the appropriate switch
4. Hands-free logging while baby is squirmy

### Scenario 3: Partner Coordination
1. Both parents see real-time status on dashboards
2. Get notifications: "Baby hasn't eaten in 3 hours"
3. Track daily patterns and share with pediatrician

## üìä Data You'll Get

- **Real-time status**: Currently feeding/sleeping
- **Daily summaries**: Number of feedings, diapers today  
- **Duration tracking**: How long each feeding/sleep session
- **History**: Complete log of all activities with timestamps
